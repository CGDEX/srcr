When Prolog unifies mulher(X) with mulher(ana), it is instantiating the variable X with the atom ana


#### Unification ####

Two terms unify if:
	- they are the same term
	- If they contain variables that can be uniformly instantiated with terms in such a way that the resulting terms are equal 

	examples:
		- ana and ana unify
		- 42 and 42 unify 
		- mulher(ana) and mulher(ana) unify
		- mulher(ana) and mulher(berta) do not unify
		- bruno and ana do not unify 
		- ana and X, they unify, X is instantiated to ana 
		- mulher(Z) and mulher(ana), Z is instantiated to ana
		- gosta(ana,X) and gosta(Y,miguel), X is instantiated to Miguel and ana to Y


#### Instantiations ####

When Prolog unifies 2 terms, it performs all the necessary instantiations so that the trms are equal 


#### Prolog testes ####


X=ana, X=bruno = False ; X is already instantiated with ana, it cant unify it with bruno anymore.

k(s(g),Y) = k(X,t(k)) = True ; X is instantiated with s(g) and Y is instantiated with t(k)
